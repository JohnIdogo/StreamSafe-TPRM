### ðŸ“˜ Phase 2: Planning

**Goal:** Define the strategic framework for a media-centric TPRM program with a focus on content protection and risk categorization.

**Key Activities:**
- Drafted the official TPRM Charter to align stakeholders and establish the projectâ€™s scope, objectives, and governance.
- Identified four key vendor risk domains: Data Privacy, IP Theft, CDN Downtime, and Compliance.
- Mapped vendor categories (Creative, Infrastructure, Analytics) against risk types and severity levels.

**Deliverables:**
- [ðŸ“„ StreamSafe TPRM Charter](StreamSafe_TPRM_Charter.docx):  
  Outlines program scope, risk areas (PII exposure, IP leakage, CDN failure), objectives, stakeholder responsibilities, and success metrics aligned to SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and CCPA.

- [ðŸ“Š Risk Area Map by Vendor Category](risk%20area%20map.png) 
  Visualizes the comparative risk levels across vendor categories using a traffic-light system (Red = High Risk, Yellow = Moderate Risk, Green = Low Risk).

**Risk Area Map Summary:**

| Vendor Category | Data Privacy Risk | IP Theft Risk | CDN Downtime Risk |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Creative         | Medium (ðŸŸ¥)        | High (ðŸŸ¨)       | Low (ðŸŸ©)            |
| Infrastructure   | Low (ðŸŸ¥)           | Low (ðŸŸ¨)        | High (ðŸŸ©)           |
| Analytics        | High (ðŸŸ¥)          | Low (ðŸŸ¨)        | Medium (ðŸŸ©)         |

**Strategic Impact:**  
Phase 2 laid the foundation for executing a focused risk-based evaluation in the following Phases. The risk map enables prioritization and control alignment for each vendor type, ensuring effective mitigation of high-impact threats to StreamSafeâ€™s digital content and customer data.
